# HAIT
for businessmen to evaluate my ability in programming (HAIT activities)

HAIT contains
	hait_analysis_exercise
	PCA
	ICA

	hait_analysis_exercise
		I wrote this as an exercise of HAIT activity.
		Please read hait_analysis_exercise/README.md for details on this.

	PCA and ICA were wrote by me alone from scratch. (Nobody has corrected these codes.)
		They were reports of my Department.(Department of Information and Communication Engineering of the UT)
		Therefore, they have some difficult points to read, but I uploaded them because I think they will help you to evaluate my capacity.
		Please have a glance through these files.

		ICA
			please read especially mylib/ICA.py. (this is main code of ICA algorithm)
			results of ICA locates at kadai*.ipynb.

		PCA
			this does PCA. I've adopted 'power method algorithm' in order to solve an eigenvalue problem.
