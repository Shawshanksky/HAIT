# HAIT
for businessmen to evaluate my ability in programming (HAIT activities)

HAIT contains 	hait_analysis_exercise, PCA, ICA.

	hait_analysis_exercise
		This is an exercise of HAIT activity.
		I challenged https://deepanalytics.jp/compe/27?tab=compedetail,
		aiming to reduce RMSE of the number of visitors to the stadium in the second half of the 2014 season.
		

	PCA and ICA
		They were reports of my Department (Department of Information and Communication Engineering of the UT)
		and wrote by me alone from scratch. (Nobody has corrected these codes.)
		Therefore, they have some difficult parts to read because they were for the professor,
		who gave these exercises and knew what these code were written about.
		But I uploaded them because I think they will help you to evaluate my capacity.
		Please have a glance through these files.

		ICA
			please read especially mylib/ICA.py. (this is main code of ICA algorithm)
			results of ICA locates at kadai*.ipynb.

		PCA
			this does PCA. I've adopted 'power method' in order to solve an eigenvalue problem.
