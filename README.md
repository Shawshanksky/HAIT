# HAIT
for businessmen to evaluate my ability in programming (HAIT activities)

This repository, HAIT , contains hait_analysis_exercise, PCA, ICA.
These codes were wrote by me alone from scratch.
(Nobody has corrected these codes and advised me.)


	hait_analysis_exercise
		This is an exercise of HAIT activity.
		I challenged https://deepanalytics.jp/compe/27?tab=compedetail
		Please read results/report.pdf for more detail.


	PCA and ICA
		They were reports of my Department (Department of Information and Communication Engineering of the UT)
		Therefore, they have some difficult parts to read because they were for the professor,
		who gave these exercises and knew what these code were written about.
		But I uploaded them because I think they will help you to evaluate my capacity.
		Please have a glance through these files.

		ICA
			please read especially mylib/ICA.py. (this is main code of ICA algorithm)
			results of ICA locates at kadai*.ipynb.

		PCA
			this does PCA. I've adopted 'power method' in order to solve an eigenvalue problem.
